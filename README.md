```

### Features

The solution offers the following features:

- **Backup Types**: Support for full schema, incremental schema, full server, and incremental server backups.
- **Scheduling**: Allows configuring multiple backup schedules with different frequencies and execution times.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email notifications about backup completion and errors, with support for multiple recipients.
- **Backup Destinations**: Support for storing backups in Digital Ocean Spaces and AWS S3.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts backups using RSA public keys.
- **Retention**: Manages backup retention, automatically deleting old backups after a specified period.

### Configuration Details

The MySQL backup solution configuration is managed through the `values.yaml` file. Here are the main configuration sections:

- **MySQL Connection Details**: Configure the MySQL host, port, username, and password.
  
  ```yaml
  mysql:
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    username: root
    password: password
  ```

- **Backup Types**: Enable or disable different types of backups.
  
  ```yaml
  backupTypes:
    schemaTotal: true
    schemaIncremental: true
    serverTotal: true
    serverIncremental: true
  ```

- **Scheduling**: Configure the scheduling parameters for each type of backup.

  ```yaml
  scheduling:
    schemaTotal:
      frequency: daily
      time: "02:00"
      maxExecutionTime: 60
    schemaIncremental:
      frequency: daily
      time: "04:00"
      maxExecutionTime: 30
    serverTotal:
      frequency: weekly
      dayOfWeek: "Sunday"
      time: "03:00"
      maxExecutionTime: 120
    serverIncremental:
      frequency: daily
      time: "06:00"
      maxExecutionTime: 45
  ```

- **Email Notifications**: Configure the email notification parameters.

  ```yaml
  notifications:
    email:
      enabled: true
      smtp:
        host: smtp.example.com
        port: 587
        username: user@example.com
        password: password
      recipients: recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
  ```

- **Backup Destinations**: Configure the settings for Digital Ocean Spaces and AWS S3.

  ```yaml
  backupDestinations:
    digitalOceanSpaces:
      enabled: true
      accessKey: DO_ACCESS_KEY
      secretKey: DO_SECRET_KEY
      region: nyc3
      bucket: my-backups
    awsS3:
      enabled: false
      accessKey: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
      secretKey: AWS_SECRET_KEY
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: my-backups
  ```

- **Encryption**: Configure the RSA public key for encryption.

  ```yaml
  encryption:
    rsaPublicKeyPath: /path/to/public.key
  ```

- **Retention**: Configure the backup retention period.

  ```yaml
  retention:
    days: 30
  ```

### Use Cases

The MySQL backup solution can be used in various scenarios to ensure reliable and automated backups of MySQL databases. Here are some use cases:

- **Daily Incremental Backups**: Configure daily incremental backups to capture changes made to the database throughout the day.
- **Weekly Full Backups**: Schedule weekly full backups to create a complete snapshot of the database, including data and structure.
- **Email Notifications**: Configure email notifications to receive alerts about backup completion and errors, ensuring timely awareness of backup status.
- **Backups to Multiple Destinations**: Store backups in multiple destinations, such as Digital Ocean Spaces and AWS S3, for redundancy and disaster recovery.
- **Encrypted Backups**: Encrypt backups using RSA public keys to ensure data security and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Backup Retention**: Manage backup retention by automatically deleting old backups after a specified period, optimizing storage usage.

### How to Deploy the Solution

#### Prerequisites

- Configured Kubernetes cluster.
- Installed Helm.

#### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devopsvanilla/mysql-k8s-backup.git
   cd mysql-k8s-backup
   ```

2. Configure the `values.yaml` file as needed.

3. Deploy the solution using Helm:

   ```sh
   helm install mysql-backup ./helm/mysql-backup
   ```

### Deployment Verification

To verify if the deployment was successful, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

Check if the pods related to the MySQL backup are running.

### Monitoring Backup Execution

To monitor the execution of backups, you can check the logs of the pods:

```sh
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Deleting the Solution

To delete the solution, run the following command:

```sh
helm uninstall mysql-backup
```

### Dependency Configuration

#### Configuring Buckets on AWS and Digital Ocean

- **AWS S3**: Create a bucket on AWS S3 and configure the access credentials in the `values.yaml` file.
- **Digital Ocean Spaces**: Create a bucket on Digital Ocean Spaces and configure the access credentials in the `values.yaml` file.

#### Generating Encryption Keys

To generate RSA keys for encryption, run the following command:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
```

Configure the path to the public key in the `values.yaml` file.

### Other Tips and References

- Ensure that the Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources to run the backup jobs.
- Regularly check the logs of the pods to ensure that backups are being executed as expected.
- Refer to the official Helm and Kubernetes documentation for more information on managing and monitoring resources in the cluster.
